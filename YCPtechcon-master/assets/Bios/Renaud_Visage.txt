Eventbrite
Technical Co-Founder
Renaud Visage is the technical architect and co-founder at Eventbrite – 12 years and 1000 employees later, he continues to leverage his entrepreneurial nature by driving innovative projects and initiatives at the company. In 2006, he joined forces with Kevin & Julia Hartz to found Eventbrite. He anticipated several fundamental shifts in the way we use the internet – including the arrival of social media, big data analysis, the shift to mobile devices as first screens and the ubiquity of APIs – and leveraged their disruptive power to Eventbrite’s advantage, fuelling the company’s growth into the powerful global ticketing and event technology platform it is today. When Renaud is not writing code, he’s mentoring and investing in startups in several European countries. Or he is taking pictures somewhere around the world.
