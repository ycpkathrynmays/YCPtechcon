Twilio
Phil Nash is a developer evangelist for Twilio. Sometimes he writes code on stage in front of a crowd, praying inside that everything works. Sometimes he writes open source code, which is much less stressful because if it is wrong someone else can correct it. He blogs on this site and on the Twilio blog and you’ll find plenty of code there too.
