Fresh Roasted Hosting - Bio 

Fresh Roasted Hosting is an independent web hosting company headquartered in vibrant Casablanca City of Morocco. Tucked in among coffee houses, independent retailers, and the oldest continually-operating market house in Morocco, we deliver all the same high-end web hosting solutions you’d expect from our larger competitors, but with much better service — and often at a better price!

We believe that web hosting is a lot of serving coffee. Anyone can buy some supermarket-brand coffee grounds, plug in an automatic coffee maker, and start selling cheap coffee in styrofoam cups. It may not taste very good, but technically speaking, it’s “coffee”. But chances are, you’d much rather spend a few cents more and go to your favorite neighborhood coffee house. Thanks to their superior ingredients and better equipment, you get a fresh, hot, perfectly-made cup of coffee that tastes as good as it smells.
